### Backgrounds 
* [m6A is one of the most abundant forms of RNA modifications](m6A_characteristics.html)
* [m6A-switch mechanisms]
* [m6A variation contributes to heritability of immune diseases]

### Genetic variants may act on m6A-switch to cause disease
[Test the enrichment for dsRNAs formed by m6A-switch with GWAS variants ](m6A_switch_to_disease_h2g.html)
  - identify genes from which transcripts can form dsRNAs among TWAS prioritized ones
  - Test enrichment for GWAS risk variants
  
### m6A informed fine-mapping
