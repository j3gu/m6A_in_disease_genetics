### Backgrounds 
* [what is m6A modification?](m6A_characteristics.html)
* [m6A-switch mechanisms]
* [m6A variation contributes to heritability of immune diseases]

### Genetic variants may act through m6A-switch to cause disease
Test the enrichment for dsRNAs formed by m6A-switch with GWAS variants 

* [identify transcripts that can form dsRNAs](check_double_strand.html)
* Test enrichment for GWAS risk variants
